        "\n",
        "a) In order to do the algorithm  we creat a function  call \"decimal_to_binary\" this  will take a decimal number as input and returns its binary representation\n",
        "\n",
        "b) First in the funtion we create a variable (\"binary\") to store the binary  representaion of the decimal numbers \n",
        "\n",
        "c) Then we creat 2 loops while. The first is use to calculate the binary number of the  decimal number only is mayor to 0, then divide the number by 2 and call the function again with the result of the division. This step is repeated until the number is 1 or 0.\n",
        "Print the remainder of the division between the number and 2. The remainder will always be 0 or 1, which represents a binary digit. At the end of the successive division process, the printed remainders represent the binary number equivalent to the original decimal number.\n",

        "Suppose we want to convert the decimal number 10 to binary.\n",
        "\n",
        "10 is greater than 1, so we divide it by 2: 10 / 2 = 5.\n",
        "\n",
        "5 is greater than 1, then we divide it by 2: 5 / 2 = 2 with a remainder of 1. We print the remainder (1).\n",
        "\n",
        "2 is greater than 1, then we divide by 2: 2 / 2 = 1 with a remainder of 0. We print the remainder (0).\n",
        "\n",
        "1 is equal to 1, then we do not divide any more and simply print the remainder (1).\n",
        "\n",
        "The printed remainder is 1010, which is the binary number equivalent to 10 in decimal.\n",
        "\n",
        "d) The secon loop while  is to check length if less then 8 will agregate 0 + binary number from the previous loop\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally we call the input for the number to be represented and then we call the function and we print the result\n"
